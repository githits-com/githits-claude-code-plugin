  Search GitHub repositories and code using the GitHits MCP server. Use when the
  user asks to find code examples, search GitHub, or discover repositories.
---

When the user wants to search GitHub — repositories, code, issues, or users —
use the GitHits MCP search tool to find results and present them clearly.

## When to use this skill

- The user asks to search GitHub or find code examples
- The user wants to discover repositories or libraries
- The user needs to find how other developers implement a specific feature or
  pattern
- The user asks to look up an API, library usage, or working code reference

## How to present results

- Show the most relevant results first
- Include repository names, descriptions, and links when available
- For code results, display the relevant code snippets with proper formatting
- If no results are found, suggest alternative search terms
