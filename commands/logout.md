description: Log out of your GitHits account

# Logout

Sign the user out of GitHits by running the CLI logout command in the terminal:

```
npx -y githits logout
```

This removes the locally stored authentication tokens.

Confirm to the user that they have been logged out successfully. If the logout
fails, provide the error details.
